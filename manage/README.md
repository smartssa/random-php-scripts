This was the start of an accounting, domain management, user management system.

Somewhere around 2004-2005 I had the idea I should make my own.

The only part that actually worked was sending invoices.

1. import the sql somewhere
2. point variables.inc.php to that somewhere
3. run it and laugh, if it works.
